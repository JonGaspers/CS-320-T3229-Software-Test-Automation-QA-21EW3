How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I can ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure by running various tests when developing the application in the future. By running unit tests and integration tests, I can see if the software I am writing works and see if it works with the rest of the program as intended. Doing code reviews and reading over the code to see if I can find any glaring logic or syntax errors is another way to ensure the code is functional and working as intended. Finally, to ensure that the code is secure, I can run various security tests on the code, for example, OWASP Vulnerability tests, to see if there are any vulnerabilities in my code. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I can interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program by interviewing the users and creating user stories to base any program modifications on in the future. By asking users directly what they think of the program, what they would like added to the program, or even what they would like to have removed from the program, I can learn what the users want and how to modify the program to match user needs. 

How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing software by first looking at a user's need; then, I start thinking of ways to provide the user's needs with the software. I then plan out how the information in the program will move around, what methods and features I would need to add, and how they will interact with other aspects of the program. Finally, I will start writing the program and testing each section as I progress through the development process. Once all of the features are written, I will begin to slowly integrate them while testing to make sure nothing breaks as I put the software together. Finally, I will run some system tests once the software is put together, and then I would provide the software to a few users to get some extra testing done, taking the beta users input and modifying the software as I move along, eventually ending beta and doing a full release. After the software is released, I would periodically do surveys to get user stories and provide maintenance for the software.
